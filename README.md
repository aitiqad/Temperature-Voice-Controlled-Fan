# Temperature-Voice-Controlled-Fan
As we all know, today's technology necessitates the use of automatic systems and  automation. 
Day by day, we're getting closer to automation. 
The goal of this project is to  design, build, and debug a Microcontroller-based system that measures temperature and  has a Voice Control feature
For controlling and manoeuvring the speed of a DC Motor-based  Fan. 
The Voice Control increases range of speeds at which the Fan can operate in,  regardless of the Temperature sampled.
As a result, the physical effort required is reduced,  making the process considerably easier.
